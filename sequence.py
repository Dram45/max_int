Ask for how many numbers user wants

Run a loop that adds together the numbers wanted

set control numbers
control number1 is 1
control number2 is 0
control number3 is 0
while generated number is less than asked print numbers run the loop
    generate number starting from 1
    number generated is sum of the last three numbers in the sequence
    print out sum of control numbers
    
    change control number2 to 1
    change control number3 to 1
    change control number1 to 0

when loop runs again control numbers should change based on the time of the loop
